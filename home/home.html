                        business. It is a multidisciplinary approach that combines principles and practices
                         from the fields of mathematics, statistics, artificial intelligence, and computer engineering 
                         to analyze large amounts of data. This analysis helps data scientists to ask and answer questions like
                         what happened, why it happened, what will happen, and what can be done with the results.
                         Data science is important because it combines tools, methods, and technology to generate meaning from data. 
                         Modern organizations are inundated with data; there is a proliferation of devices that can automatically 
                         collect and store information. Online systems and payment portals capture more data in the fields of
                          e-commerce, medicine, finance, and every other aspect of human life. We have text, audio, video, 
                          and image data available in vast quantities.While the term data science is not new, the meanings and connotations 
                          have changed over time. The word first appeared in the ’60s as an alternative name 
                          for statistics. In the late ’90s, computer science professionals formalized the term. A 
                          proposed definition for data science saw it as a separate field with three aspects: data design, collection, and analysis. It still
                          took another decade for the term to be used outside of academia.

                    <hr class="line">
                    <p class="para">Cyber security is the practice of defending computers, servers, mobile devices, electronic
                         systems, networks, and data from malicious attacks. It's also known as information technology security or 
                         electronic information security. The term applies in a variety of contexts, from business to mobile computing,
                          and can be divided into a few common categories.Network security is the practice of securing a computer network from intruders, 
                          whether targeted attackers or opportunistic malware.
                          Application security focuses on keeping software and devices free of threats.
                           A compromised application could provide access to the data its designed to protect. 
                          Successful security begins in the design stage, well before a program or device is deployed.
                          Disaster recovery and business continuity define how an organization responds to a cyber-security incident 
                          or any other event that causes the loss of operations or data. Disaster recovery policies dictate how the organization 
                          restores its operations and information to return to the same operating capacity as before the event. 
                          Business continuity is the plan the organization falls back on while trying to operate without certain resources.
